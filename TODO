- use lib-ruler (this is needed to work with height ruler)
- build system for releases
    - Use webpack or something else?
- register with foundryvtt modules?
- Block movement through hostiles? Make it a setting?
- Use drag ruler dynamically (or implement my own path finding?)
    - At the very least have the highlight color change based on movement speed?
- Use terrain ruler dynamically (or implement my own version?)
- Allow for multiple token control?
- Incorporate token size for purposes of moving through others?
- Have a grid of movement, based on speed, show up when starting your move?
